ICRA - may16-21
back in ekm 26 may, began skimming through the ICRA pendrive
	Compliant mechanisms for bram
	Study about direct drive actuators - Asada
june 6-18 trip
	reading, thinking...
June 18
	linear direct drive actuator - animals - linear muscles
	FEM, CAD model, pr
June 27- 
	3d print
June 30 
	winding coils
July 3-5- 
	electronics done, no commutation, bare & primitive control software -first move
July 10:
	FEM for aluminum rod, design changes, purchase rod
July 14-20
	Bosch Blr and CBE
	study , refer, think
July 22- 24:
	Aluminum rod + 3D print+ coil winding
July 25- Aug4
	Realization that this wont be complete soon. I need to do the commutation, impedance and dampng controllers in software etc etc.. Then I have to machine it sturdy to that cheeta can jump etc
	Thinking to use Off the shelf Faulhaber motor- studing its characteristics, developing controllers.
 AUg 5-9 
	Hyderabad trip
