excerpt: "ICRA-2017: My first Paper Presentation"
---

I was very very lucky, to have my first research paper accepted to the top conference in robotics -  International COnference on Robotics and Automation, which was held in SIngapore, 2017 May.

 It was an awesome experience.My travel partner was my longtime friend Lentin.

  Unlike the previous ICRA at Stockholm, here the paper presentations were done in numerous smaller rooms rather than a big auditorium.

I was also lucky to meet Prof. Oussama Khatib from Stanford University. Even though a very busy person, he quickly recognised us also, since we have met for the 2016 ICRA. He remembered us as the ICRA2016 challenge winners and my friend Lentin as the "Book Author Guy"

I have been hoping to meet him this time too. Guess what, I was carrying the heavy "Springer Handbook of Robotics" in my backpack everytime, so that whenever I meet him, I can ask for his autograph. It paid off well. Wow, I got an autographed copy

I also made a lot of friends during the conference.

and I could ride a Self Driving Scooter through the Singapore Super-Tree park. It was a joint project of MIT and NUS

I accidently ran into some guys during lunch. They were at the conference to present their work on a novel gripper based on Gelsight. It could provide 3D contact points between the gripper and object.

 I found this pretty cool, and have been thinking a bit about using such a gripper for more intelligent grasping
