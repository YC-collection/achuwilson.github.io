I had the priceless opportunity to attend the IEEE sponsored International Conference on Robotics and Automation [ICRA](https://www.icra2016.org) at Stockholm. I was one of the three member team "Autobots" that won the Humanitarion Robotics Challenge (HRATC).

 The excitement was immense- it was my first conference, it was my first international trip, and moreover, the excitemnt of meeting eminent robotics researchers, attending their talks and seeing the cutting edge research happening worldwide.
 
 The conference started on May 16th. Somehow, we missed our connection flight from Dubai to Stockhom and ended showing up late. 
 I missed the very first talk I was looking forward to, 'HUMANS 2.0', by Dr. Hugh Herr. He is one badass guy who inspires many.
