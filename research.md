My research is fuellled by my own curiousity and passion of robots. My interests spans around robot manipulation, computer vision, machine learning, agile and dynamic robots and control, quadrupeds, direct drive robots capable of highly dynamic motions, compliant robot manipulators, novel actuator technologies, personal robots and human robot interaction, manipulation of deformable objects etc

# **Research Projects**

**1. [Magneto-Rheological Linear Clutch for force controlled safe robots.](http://achuwilson.github.io/blog/2016/09/how_i_wrote_research_paper_in_30_days/)**

This project explored the design, simulation and prototyping of a linear clutch which controls force transmitted from the actuator to the robot links.  The force was coupled through MR fluid and the level of magnetization controlled the amount of force transmitted.

 This is the first research project I took up and completed in a very short of time, yet accepted for a top tier conference. You can read how I managed to pull this off and what all i studied by working alone in my [blog](http://achuwilson.github.io/blog/2016/09/how_i_wrote_research_paper_in_30_days/)




**2. [Mid air stabilization of jumping quadrupeds using an active spine.](#)**

This research aims to mimic the reflex action of cats, which enables them to land safely on all the four limbs. A 2DOF active spine enables  the quadruped to rotate the frontal and dorsal parts of the torso. Making usage of the conservation of momentum, the quadruped can orient itself in mid air. As of now, the concept is verified in simulation and the prototyping is being done
