" ***Bitten by a robot bug in teenage, now I often see robots in my dreams.*** "

I graduated from [Govt. Engineering College,Sreekrishnapuram](http://www.gecskp.ac.in) under [University of Calicut](http://www.universityofcalicut.info/) with a Bachelors in Electronics and Communication. Since then I taught myself theories of robotics, computer vision and AI from  Books, Internet, MOOCs and making & breaking robots. I have been working with real robots for the past 6 years and I have co-founded a company.([Sastra Robotics](http://www.sastrarobotics.com)). My work at Sastra consists of using robot manipulators for automated device testing. We manufacture and customize robot arms for testing HMI Panels, Touchscreen devices, consumer electronics etc.

Often I get myself involved with some self inspired, curiosity driven research projects, so that I can push my limits and contribute to the advancement of robotics. My research interests are mostly in robot manipulation in unstructured human environments, bio inspired robots etc.

 I am also a  ["good procrastinator"](http://paulgraham.com/procrastination.html), who puts away less important stuffs of life for the bigger and challenging ones. Challenges always fascinated me. I was one among the three member team Autobots that **won the 2016 ICRA Humanitarian Robotics Challenge (HRATC) at Stockholm**. I could do research on my own, even without any previous publishing experience or even an advisor, I managed to **publish my first paper in one of the top tier robotics conference, at ICRA-2017**.  See more of the interesting challenges I am working on right now in the [Research](http://achuwilson.github.io/research/) page
