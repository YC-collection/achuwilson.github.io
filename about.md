"Bitten by a robot bug in teenage, now I see robots in dreams."

I graduated from [Govt. Engineering College,Sreekrishnapuram](http://www.gecskp.ac.in) under [University of Calicut](http://www.universityofcalicut.info/) with a Bachelors in Electronics and Communication. Since then I taught myself theories of robotics, computer vision and AI from  Books, Internet, MOOCs and making & breaking robots. I am looking forward for a graduate research program( PhD !!!).My research interests include personal robotics, compliant and direct drive actuation for human safe personal robots, manipulation of deformable materials etc. If any of the professors are reading this and is interested in me, I am always ready for a talk.

I spend most of the time forcing some stubborn robot to do something meaningful. When I am not with the robots, you can find me reading something or exploring new places.  My reading list spans from technical journals and magazines to philosophy and life. In short I am a voracious reader.

 I am also a  ["good"](http://paulgraham.com/procrastination.html) procrastinator, who puts away less important stuffs of life for the bigger ones.
